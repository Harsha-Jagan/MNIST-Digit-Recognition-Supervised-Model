# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Supervised-Model
A supervised learning Neural Network that implements stochastic gradient descent to learn to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.






The following four files were taken from Finn Eggers's youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O2rlikBHcA) description and were used to process the Mnist data files:

1. MnistDbFile.java 
2. MnistImageFile.java 
3. MnistImageLoader.java 
4. MnistLabelFile.java 

All other files were written solely by the author of this repository, Harshavardhan Jagannathan.
